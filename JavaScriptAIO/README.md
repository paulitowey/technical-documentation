# Gamelet

A starter program for writing JavaScript games.

## Usage

1. Include gamelet.js in an HTML document containing an element with an id of 'ball'.

```html
<div id="ball">@</div>
<script src="gamelet.js"></script>
```

2. The script will detect when the up or down arrow
   keys are pressed, and it will move the ball element accordingly.
