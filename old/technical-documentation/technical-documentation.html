    <p>One Punch Man is a Japanese superhero franchise created by the artist ONE. The story revolves around Saitama, a superhero who can defeat any opponent with a single punch, but who struggles with boredom and existential crisis due to the lack of a formidable challenge. The series combines action, comedy, and satire, parodying typical superhero and shonen tropes.</p>

    <p>One Punch Man began as a webcomic in 2009, which quickly gained popularity. It was then adapted into a manga illustrated by Yusuke Murata and published on the Young Jump Web Comics website. The manga's success led to an anime adaptation by Madhouse, which aired in 2015, followed by a second season animated by J.C. Staff in 2019.</p>
